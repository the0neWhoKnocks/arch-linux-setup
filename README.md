# Setup: Linux

Scripts and documentation to automate Linux setups.

Distros
- [Arch](distro/arch)
- Mint
   - [Cinnamon](distro/mint-cinnamon) (currently has the most in-depth instructions)
   - [XFCE](distro/mint-xfce) (minimal documentation)
   - If you later choose that you want to try out a different Session Manager, install the appropriate package below via `apt install`, log out, and choose the new manager before you login (there should be a drop-down).
      ```sh
      mint-meta-cinnamon
      mint-meta-mate
      mint-meta-xfce
      ```
